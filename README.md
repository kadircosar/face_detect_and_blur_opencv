# Clone scripts
Run this code in terminal in the path  where you want it to be cloned :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kadircosar/kadircosar-face_detect_and_blur_opencv/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
unzip master.zip
```

# Install requirements
I recommend you create a new conda or a virtualenv environment to run your open-cv experiments as to not mess up dependencies of any existing project. Once you have activated the new environment, install the dependencies using pip.
before running this code in terminal make sure activate your venv that you created for this project and run this code in path that you cloned face_detect_and_blur_opencv.
